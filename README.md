# Election_Analysis
An analysis of the U.S. Congressional race (Colorado Precinct) using Python

## Project Overview:
In this project, I was using my knowledge of analysis to assist a Board of Elections employee (Tom) with an election audit for a Congressional precinct in the state of Colorado. In order to fully and effectively conduct the audit, I did the following:

- Report the total number of votes cast in the election.
- Report the total number of votes cast for each candidate.
- Determine the percentage of votes for each candidate.
- Determine the winner of the election (based off the popular vote) aka “who had the most votes.”

I went into the project with the intention of assisting Tom with the Congressional election audit. I was also looking for a way to automate the process for other potential elections! Tom and I wanted to take a process that could be done using Microsoft Excel, but automate it for future use, and to make it more efficient using Python.

## Resources:
The audit was conducted accurately using the following resources:

- Data Source (provided): election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.10.1, Visual Studio Code Version: 1.63.2 (Universal)

## Summary:
The analysis of the election show that there was a total of 369,711 votes cast in this election.  These votes were collected using 3 voting methods (Mail-in ballots, Punch cards, and Direct Recording Electronic.)

The 369,711 votes were cast in favor of 3 candidates:

1. Charles Casper Stockham
2. Diana DeGette
3. Raymon Anthony Doane

The results of the election results are as followed:

- **Charles Casper Stockham** received: 23 % of the votes and 85,213 of votes
- **Diana DeGette** received: 73.8 % of the votes and 272,892 of votes
- **Raymon Anthony Doane** received: 3.1 % of the votes and 11,606 of votes

The winner of the election based off the popular votes was:

Diana DeGette who received: 73.8 % of the votes and 272,892 of votes.
